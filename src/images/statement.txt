Description

You are designing your own library and now you have to make your
own shuffle function that takes a list and returns the shuffled from,
i.e. all nodes are shuffled.

You think that the ideal approach is to take one node from the
beginning and then one from the end untill all nodes are covered.
You do not have to output anything. Just complete the shuffleAll
function such that the shuffled list also has the same pointer as head.
shuffleAll has the following parameters:

-LinkedListNode pointer list:a reference to the head node in the list

Input Description

Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer n, the number of elements
in the linked list.

The next line contains n integers, the node data values in order.
Constraints

1 <=n <= 1045

1 <= node values <= 1044

Output Description
